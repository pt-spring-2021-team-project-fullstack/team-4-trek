                    <h1> WHAT IS TREKKING?</h1>
                    <p>Simply put, trekking is an outdoor activity that involves walking for more than a day. The
                        objective, in general, is to pursue your surroundings and explore the ravishing scenery. </p>
                    <p>Due to the testing of one's ability, endurance and psychological capacity, Trekking is
                        significantly more challenging than other activities such as hiking.</p>
                    <p>There are countless ways to trek, each environment has its own culture!</p>
                    <p>Trekking is mainly of four kinds: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Easy Trekking: Usually for beginners, this type of trekking normally involves the view of
                            vivid horizons and/or breathtaking nature. </li>
                        <li>Moderate Trekking: More challenging than easy, it is performed on medium to slightly higher
                            altitudes. PLEASE be energetic if you're interested in this type of trekking.</li>
                        <li>Strenuous Trekking: Like its name, this type of trekking requires strenuous physical
                            efforts. Usually done in high altitude regions, this type is ONLY suitable for those who
                            have prior trekking experience.</li>
                        <li>Difficult Trekking: Pick this level if you are looking for steep slopes. In our experience,
                            extremely experienced or professional sign up for these journeys. You will need precision
                            and a crazy amount of endurance to get through these trips.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h1>TWO MAIN TYPES OF TREKKING</h1>
                    <h3>Teahouse (Lodge) Trekking</h3>
                    <p> Offering a bit of comfort on some of the harshest terrain in the world, Teahouse Trekking may be

                        like this, you will not only have the added benefit of minimizing your costs, but you will also
                        decrease your chances of adverse weather conditions.</p>
                    <h3>Fully Organized (Camping) Trekking</h3>
                    <p>Trekkers sleep in tents overnight and awake to catered meals, individually curated in advanced,
                        PER guest. Trekkers may select between a plethora of cuisines to suit their palates; whether
                        it's western, continental or local cuisine. Trekkers completely rely on locally-hired staff.
                        You'd be surprise at the amount of help that's needed! Just imagine: The trekkers personal gear
                        plus the group's equipment & food!</p>
